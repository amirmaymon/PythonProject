couple of points apout the project:

~ I decided to make the time and date internal, the days are changed menualy through the menue in a linear way.

~ I also asummed that the librarian and customers aren't very good with computers,
     so the input is always checked and in some cases if the user input is invalid a default decivion is made for
     them instead of retryng until they "get it".

~ also the days can only be skipped for small periods as if every skip is a new workday in the library.
    it both avoids problems with short term loans being all late at once and keeps a bit of realism.
